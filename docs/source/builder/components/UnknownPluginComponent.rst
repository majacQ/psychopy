Unknown Plugin Component
-------------------------------

Similar to :ref:`unknowncomponent`, Unknown Plugin Components are Components which PsychoPy doesn't recognise, but which declare themselves as coming from a particular plugin. This means you need to install the plugin for PsychoPy to properly recognise and make use of the Component.

Thankfully, installing the necessary plugin is easy! Just open up the Component and click the link at the bottom:
