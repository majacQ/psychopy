What font should the text be displayed in? Locally, can be a font installed on your computer, saved to the "fonts" folder in your |PsychoPy| user folder, or the name of a `Google Font <https://fonts.google.com>`_. Online, can be any `web safe font <https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_websafe_fonts.php>`_ or a font file added to your resources list in :ref:`expSettings`.
